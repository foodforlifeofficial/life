              In Palestine, the intensified conflict since October 2023 has
              triggered a severe humanitarian crisis. More than 1.8 million
              people are experiencing food insecurity, and many of them have
              lost their homes, finding refuge in temporary shelters. Similarly,
              in Ukraine, following attacks by Russia, many children and
              families are struggling to survive and in urgent need of support.
              Food for Life aims to reach as many people as possible, constantly
              expanding the network of volunteers to make a real difference in
              the lives of those affected. Together we can bring comfort and
              hope where it is needed most. 💙
