                  The situation in Palestine, especially in the Gaza Strip, is
                  marked by armed conflicts and a deep humanitarian crisis
                  characterized by famine and massive destruction. The clashes
                  generated a severe food crisis. International organizations
                  warn that hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza are facing
                  starvation. A UN report from October 2024 estimates that
                  around 345,000 people in the Gaza Strip will reach
                  "catastrophic" levels of hunger this winter, up from 133,000
                  today. Palestinian officials and representatives of the
                  international community have accused Israel of using
                  starvation as a weapon of war by restricting access to food,
                  water and medicine. The Palestinian Foreign Minister stated in
                  December 2023 that Israel is deliberately using starvation
                  against the population of Gaza. Children are among the most
                  affected by this crisis. Malnutrition and lack of access to
                  adequate health services have led to an alarming increase in
                  cases of illness and death among minors. The UN reported that
                  Gaza now has "the highest number of child amputees per capita
                  in the world", many of them losing their limbs and undergoing
                  surgery without anaesthesia.

                  Children in conflict zones, such as Palestine and Ukraine,
                  live in a reality marked by deep suffering, insecurity and
                  acute deprivation. In Palestine, especially in the Gaza Strip,
                  the war turned childhood into a nightmare. Thousands of
                  children have been killed or injured, and those who survive
                  face daily shortages of food, water and medicine. Destroyed
                  streets and bombed homes no longer offer safety, and schools
                  frequently become collateral targets of attacks. Education
                  comes to an abrupt halt and the prospect of a stable future
                  vanishes under the weight of continued violence.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In Ukraine, the war has forced millions of children from their
                  homes, some becoming refugees in other countries, while others
                  live in underground shelters, hiding from bombings. Lack of
                  food, limited access to medical care and psychological trauma
                  become part of their daily lives. Many children have spent
                  years without going to school, growing up in a climate
                  dominated by fear and uncertainty.

              In both conflicts, children are affected by devastating losses –
              be it parents, friends or their own homes. Malnutrition is
              becoming more widespread and hunger is becoming a silent but
              lethal weapon. Hospitals are overwhelmed, and in many cases, basic
              treatments are lacking, leaving children to suffer in silence.

              This reality outlines a generation for whom war has become
              normality, a generation that sees its future threatened at every
              turn. The international community looks on with concern, but
              solutions are slow to bring immediate relief. Despite humanitarian
              efforts, children continue to be the most vulnerable to these
              tragedies, and their voices often go unheard, lost in the noise of
              conflict.
